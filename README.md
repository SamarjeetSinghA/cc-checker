During my Harward CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course, in week 1, I was given a very interesting real-world project, which I had to program in C.

The goal was to get a Credit Card number as Input from the user and check if it's a Valid Credit Card Number, and which card network the card belongs to. (Amex, Visa, Mastercard)

I was introduced to a very sophisticated algorithm that checks if the card number is valid or not, the algorithm is called the Luhn algorithm.

I had first to recreate the algorithm in C and check if the card number is valid or not, and then find the card network using another set of rules (starting digits and card number length).

Multiple Errors later, I finally made the program that worked correctly!

It was my first Project in C and I loved it because it was not just another program but one that has a real-world use case.

It might not be the most efficient, but hey! It was my day 2 of learning C.
